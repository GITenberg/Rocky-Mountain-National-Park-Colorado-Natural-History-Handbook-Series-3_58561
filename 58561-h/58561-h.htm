<p>Rocky Mountain National Park, established on January 26, 1915, and containing
about 410 square miles, is administered by the National Park Service,
U.S. Department of the Interior.</p>
<p>The National Park System, of which this park is a unit, is dedicated to conserving
the scenic, scientific, and historic heritage of the United States for the
benefit and enjoyment of its people.</p>
<p>A superintendent is in immediate charge of Rocky Mountain National Park,
with headquarters in Estes Park village on the east side of the park. Address
communications to the Superintendent, Rocky Mountain National Park, Box
1086, Estes Park, Colo.</p>
<h3 class="center">America&rsquo;s Natural Resources</h3>
<p>Created in 1849, the Department of the Interior&mdash;America&rsquo;s Department of
Natural Resources&mdash;is concerned with the management, conservation, and development
of the Nation&rsquo;s water, wildlife, mineral, forest, and park and recreational
resources. It also has major responsibilities for Indian and territorial
affairs.</p>
<p>As the Nation&rsquo;s principal conservation agency, the Department works to assure
that nonrenewable resources are developed and used wisely, that park and
recreational resources are conserved, and that renewable resources make their
full contribution to the progress, prosperity, and security of the United States&mdash;now
and in the future.</p>

pioneers, and led indirectly to the settlement of the verdant meadows
at the foot of the Front Range in the vicinity of modern Estes Park,
and eventually to a &ldquo;rush&rdquo; of vacationists. As the scenic splendor of
this region became better known, many public-spirited citizens recognized
the need for preserving portions of the area as a National
Park. In 1915, Rocky Mountain National Park was dedicated in
simple ceremonies, at what is now called Horseshoe Park. Since
that time millions of visitors have enjoyed the natural wonders of
the park, including placid mountain lakes, rushing streams, and
verdant high-country meadows. Here are trout to catch, native mammals
and birds to be seen and photographed, and trails to hike.</i></p>

<p class="tb">Park rangers are often asked, &ldquo;What are the main attractions of
Rocky Mountain National Park?&rdquo; It is hard to answer this question,
for the appeal of the park, somewhat like that of a symphony,
lies in the varied yet repeated experiences or melodies which may be
found within its framework. The raw beauty of the rugged mountains
contrasts with the calm loveliness of wildflower gardens growing
nearby. Some visitors enjoy the solitude, while others appreciate the
opportunity to meet people with like interests and to hike with organized
groups on some of the 200 miles of trails. Many derive
pleasure from quietly studying the fascinating world of nature preserved
in the park. Some vigorously battle the steep slopes of the
mountains; others relax in camp, soothed by the sound of the wind
in the trees. Each person enjoys the park in his own way. There
are regulations, but no regimentation, no compulsory activities, no
&ldquo;musts.&rdquo; The park was established for all to use, but not to abuse.</p>
<p>Rocky Mountain National Park comprises about 400 square miles
of the Front Range. The altitude of the park is high, with cool summers
the inevitable result. There are more than 65 named peaks
exceeding 10,000 feet. The Continental Divide, separating slopes
draining to the Pacific Ocean from those draining to the Gulf of
Mexico, runs through the park.</p>

<p>To those who study it, the park reveals stories of great natural
dramas of earth forces that made its deep gorges and lofty peaks, and
of once-mighty glaciers that carved its remote lakes. Its forests and
wildflowers tell a story of struggle and adjustment to environments
that differ with altitude and exposure. Its native populations&mdash;deer,
elk, bear, beaver, birds and the myriad lesser creatures of the wild&mdash;can
be seen in their natural habitats. Its streams attract the hopeful
fisherman; its unmodified natural compositions enthrall the artist;
its cool, green setting appeals to all summer travelers.</p>
<p>Enos Mills, &ldquo;father&rdquo; of Rocky Mountain National Park, wrote about
40 years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A National Park is a fountain of life.... Without parks and outdoor
life all that is best in civilization will be smothered. To save ourselves&mdash;to
enable us to live at our best and happiest, parks are necessary.
Within National Parks is room&mdash;glorious room&mdash;room in which to find
ourselves, in which to think and hope, to dream and plan, to rest, and
resolve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His words are even more significant to our generation than they
were to his. This booklet is an attempt to provide a concise summary
of some of the park&rsquo;s important natural values and to arouse your
appetite for further pursuit of the enjoyment they offer. The basic
experience in this National Park, as in most, is to capture some of the
inspiration and spiritual qualities of the landscape which Enos Mills
felt so keenly.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">THE MOUNTAINS ARE MADE</span></h2>
<p>The geological story of Rocky Mountain National Park is a long
one. Most of its details are lost in the passage of hundreds of millions
of years. Some of the story has been put together by scientists from
bits of evidence scattered here and there. The evidence strongly indicates
a certain chain of events, but no eyewitnesses are available to
confirm the deductions. Few of these events can be proved to everyone&rsquo;s
satisfaction; we can but pass on to you some determinations that
geologists have made.</p>
<p>Most of the rocks which you see in the park are crystalline and very
ancient. The gneiss and schist were, in part, once sediments formed
in seas, perhaps a billion years ago, under conditions about which there
is little knowledge or general agreement. These sediments were
buried beneath thousands of feet of other sediments, cemented and
hardened into layers of sedimentary rock and later squeezed, crushed,
and elevated by slow, ceaselessly working earth forces that produced
mountains even in that ancient time. During this period the sedimentary
rocks were changed to harder metamorphic rocks, probably
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
because of deep burial under tremendous pressure and considerable
heat. Masses of molten rock welled up into these earlier deposits
and hardened under the earth&rsquo;s surface. This later (though still very
ancient) intrusive material is now exposed granite in many parts of
Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="623" />
<p class="pcap">Rocks once buried miles deep are now exposed on Longs Peak, at an altitude
of more than 14,000 feet.</p>
</div>
<p>These ancient mountains were gradually worn away by wind, rain,
and other agents of erosion, which must have attacked the surface of
the earth as vigorously then as now. With the passage of millions
of years, these mountains were reduced to a lowland. Another sea
gradually lapped over the land where mountains had been, and once
again sediments were dropped in its bottom. This new invasion of
the ocean affected the park region during many millions of years in
which the dinosaurs dominated the earth.</p>
<p>In response to little-understood rhythms of the earth&rsquo;s crust, which
have lifted mountains ever so slowly at great intervals all over the
world, the seas drained away as the crust rose again, and the rising
land once more became subject to the ceaseless attack of erosion. This
uplift&mdash;which began about 60 million years ago&mdash;originated the system
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
of mountain ranges and basins that today give Colorado its
spectacular scenery and much of its climate. This great period of
mountain-making is called the Laramide Revolution, from its early
recognition in the Laramie Basin region of Wyoming.</p>
<p>The Front Range, of which this park preserves a choice sample, was
buckled in the fashion of a great long wrinkle in a carpet. This &ldquo;roll&rdquo;
of rock was about 200 miles long and some 40 miles across. In its
earlier stages it was covered by the arched-up sediments, but, as time
passed and erosion continued, the inner core of earlier crystalline rocks
was exposed once again. Today, all traces of the former thick mantle
of sedimentary beds are gone from the park. They are still present
beneath the plains to the east and the basins to the west, and the cut-off
ends of some of them now lie exposed in a tilted position against both
east and west flanks of the mountains. The sandstones of some of
the hogback ridges crossed by the approach roads from Lyons and
Loveland are a part of this once continuous overburden.</p>
<p>Uplift continued intermittently during many millions of years. In
the western section of the park, volcanic eruptions took place. Specimen
Mountain is the remnant of a volcano; some of its flows are seen
today as the cliffs behind Iceberg Lake, on Trail Ridge Road. Great
sheets of lava and other volcanic rocks piled in layers now make up
much of the Never Summer Range. Eventually, these rocks, too, will
be stripped away by the relentless work of erosion; this will require
millions of years.</p>
<p>An unusual feature of the landscape here is the rolling, sometimes
flattened character of many mountain summits. Trail Ridge Road
crosses several miles of one of these summits&mdash;a gently rolling upland
above 11,000 feet. These mountaintops appear to be all that is left
of an old land surface that once may have been continuous far eastward
over the area occupied today by the Great Plains. Such surfaces,
of which the mountains in the park show many good remnants, are
called peneplains. Their presence atop the mountains is a part of the
evidence suggesting that the range had been worn down by erosion
to a fairly flat upland a few million years ago. Then renewed uplifting
occurred, and streams draining the highland gradually cut canyons
two or three thousand feet into the elevated surface.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">THE WORK OF GLACIERS</span></h2>
<p>These canyons were filled by glaciers at intervals during the million
years of the ice age. This period saw the formation of vast ice fields
over much of northern North America. The causes of the ice age are
complex, but its effects on our landscape are marked and convincing.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Every large high-altitude canyon in what is now Rocky Mountain
National Park became filled with snow, much of which, under pressure,
turned to ice. The glaciers thus formed, moving under their own
great weight&mdash;slowly, but with tremendous power&mdash;broadened, deepened,
and straightened the twists and turns of the original river-cut
valleys, and, bit by bit, scooped out bowls, or cirques, at the glacier
sources. These glaciers quarried and removed untold millions of
tons of rocks from the upper reaches. Many of the cliffs and lakes
of the park are the results of excavating done by the mountain glaciers.</p>
<p>These glaciers were entirely local; they did not extend down to the
plains in this region. At what is now an altitude of about 8,200 feet&mdash;just
below present-day Moraine Park, Horseshoe Park, Wild Basin,
and a few miles below Grand Lake in the Colorado River valley&mdash;the
glacier fronts melted as fast as the ice advanced. It was there
that most of the rock debris plucked from higher up was dropped.
Piles of rock are scattered over most of the meadowlands of this general
altitude. These rock deposits are called moraines&mdash;ridges and
heaps, or scattered masses, of unsorted rock debris dumped where
they settled from the melting ice. Classic examples of moraines may
be seen in Moraine Park, named for these special features. You can
learn more about them at the Moraine Park Visitor Center.</p>
<p>When climatic changes caused the glaciers to melt back faster than
they advanced, the moraines, like modern dams, formed lakes behind
them whenever stream drainage from the shrinking glaciers was
checked. Several such lakes, now silted in and changed to green
meadows, occupied lower regions in the park. There are good examples
of these lakes in Horseshoe Park and Moraine Park.</p>

<p class="pcap">Bierstadt Ridge, a huge glacial moraine, seen en route to Bear Lake.</p>
</div>
<p>The glaciers invaded the park valleys several times during the ice
age. Usually, two distinguishable ages of moraines can be seen; the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
older and more extensive one is made up of well-weathered, &ldquo;rotten&rdquo;
boulders and finer material, while the newer ones are scarcely altered
at all. It is thought that the last great glaciers retreated only some
12,000 years ago. Indians lived on the plains at that time!</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">

<p class="pcap">Andrews Glacier, late in season. Note crevasse in upper middle of glacier.</p>
</div>
<p>It is by no means certain that the glacier age is entirely a thing
of the past. Five small glaciers, or &ldquo;glacierets,&rdquo; of geologically recent
origin&mdash;Taylor, Andrews, Tyndall, Rowe, and Sprague&mdash;exist today
in the park. They are much smaller than the earlier glaciers; but
they are ice masses, and they are moving (though very slowly); so
they are glaciers by definition. They are accessible only by arduous
foot travel, but the first three are visible from heavily traveled roads
and trails of the park.</p>
<p>The story of the geological events, as we have seen, is long. The
landscape of today, we now realize, is transient. It is the contemporary
product of processes that have been working day and night throughout
geologic time. These processes will certainly go on and on, and inevitably
will continue to change the landscape. Each year sees some
little modification here and there. These small changes are not linked
in our thinking with the vast sweep of geologic time, probably because
our own lives are so very short. With some reflection we seem
to catch glimpses of eternity as we examine the ancient gray cliffs
and mighty peaks of Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">THE MOUNTAINS ARE MANTLED WITH PLANTS</span></h2>
<p>Having seen that the present mountains are the result of past events,
we should not be surprised to learn that the plant cover of the park
is also dependent on what has occurred before. We are inclined to
think of a plant community, such as a forest, as a permanent fixture;
but it is a dynamic, never-stagnant population of individual living
things, and in some ways resembles a community of people.</p>
<p>Just as human populations ebb and flow through periods of great
numerical growth and dominance, followed by decline and engulfment
by invading peoples, so do vegetation types go through periods of
dominance and decline. When certain conditions of climate and soil
prevail, those kinds of plants best adapted to such conditions will dominate
the scene. As conditions change, the flora will change.</p>
<p>In Rocky Mountain National Park, we assume that toward the end
of the ice age most of the high altitude landscape was either ice-covered
or barren, like our present-day rockpiles above treeline. As
the ice melted and disappeared, the bare rocks of the canyons were
exposed, and lakes occupied what are now the meadows. The climate
was changing, though, and the rather sparse arctic-type plantlife was
superseded by another vegetation complex, except on the very tops of
the mountains.</p>
<p>The ice-age vegetation was presumably connected with that of the
regions bordering the Arctic Ocean. The present tundra of the high
country in the park is an island of arctic-type vegetation, surrounded
on all sides by plant communities of lower latitudes. Will it be engulfed
some day and replaced by surrounding plant types? If the
climate continues to moderate, the answer may be &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of the original sparse arctic flora has already disappeared. The
bare rocks were first invaded by lichens&mdash;those plant pioneers still
to be seen on rocks in the park. In the thin soil formed by their life
processes, other primitive plants became established. As the climate
moderated and soils formed where bare rocks formerly existed, a new
vegetation complex replaced the old.</p>
<p>We suppose that all sorts of plants got started on this new land, but
only those species which happened to be adapted for the particular
conditions of their time would last long enough to become well established
and to produce ample seeds for future generations. This selective
elimination of plants which were not adjusted to the changing
conditions results in the dominance of certain well-adjusted species.
In this way, according to scientists, a climax vegetation develops for a
particular situation. As long as the climate remains about the same,
the climax vegetation remains relatively stable.</p>

<p class="pcap">Rugged cliffs and mighty peaks are spectacular products of geologic forces.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Although it has been thousands of years since these plant communities
first started on the glaciated bedrock, the struggle for dominance
among the plants still goes on. Conditions are not yet completely
static and probably never will be. The meadows, the forests, and the
barrens of today may be quite different in a distant tomorrow.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">PLANT COMMUNITIES</span></h2>
<h3 id="c5">Below 9,000 Feet</h3>
<p>In the lower slopes of the park, below approximately 9,000 feet
altitude, usually described as the Montane zone, the climate is relatively
warm and dry. This type of climate has encouraged a fairly
consistent pattern of vegetation that may be considered climax. The
forests in this zone are open. The trees are likely to be scattered in
characteristically parklike stands and are made up mostly of ponderosa
pine. On cool north slopes the stands are thicker, with Douglas-fir
sprinkled in or even dominant. With the ponderosa pine on drier
sites is juniper (commonly called &ldquo;cedar&rdquo;), and above 8,000 feet thick
stands of lodgepole pine are sometimes admixed. Along the streams
are the distinctive and graceful Colorado blue spruce, associated with
willows, birch, and alder. Aspen groves and, in lower altitudes, cottonwoods
appear here and there. Many types of shrubs, some characteristic
of the foothills, grow in the Montane zone.</p>
<p>The most characteristic forest tree of the lower part of this zone is
<span class="small">PONDEROSA PINE</span>. It has dull-green needles from 3 to 6 inches long&mdash;longer
than those of other pines in the park&mdash;which are usually in
bundles of three. Although the bark on young trees is black, the
mature trees have a yellow-brown bark in characteristically rectangular
plates. The cones are about 3 inches long, with prickles on the tips
of the cone scales. Capable of growing in warm, dry environments,
it is an evergreen of south-facing slopes and is widespread as a forest
tree in the southwestern United States. On the cooler, north-facing
slopes, <span class="small">DOUGLAS-FIR</span> mingles with the ponderosa pine. Douglas-fir is
easily identified by its needles, which grow singly along the branch
instead of in sheaths. The needles are flat, blunt, and about 1 inch
long; and they have a narrow stalk at the base that pulls off with the
needle. This distinguishes it from the blue spruce often found in the
same vicinity. The bark is smooth and gray on young trees, but
rough, brownish, and deeply furrowed on older trees. The cones are
about 2 inches long, made up of broad scales each with a projecting
3-pronged bract. Here, Douglas-fir seldom attains the great size for
which it is noted in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Another conifer growing in this zone, usually along streams or in
such other wet locations, is <span class="small">BLUE SPRUCE</span>, one of the most admired evergreens
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
of the West. Its needles produce a bloom, or powder, which
gives the tree a distinctive bluish or silver aspect, especially noticeable
in midsummer. The cones are from 3 to 5 inches long, tan-colored,
with many scales, which have narrow tips but no prickles.</p>
<p>In the upper parts of the Montane zone grow dense forests of <span class="small">LODGEPOLE
PINE</span>, so named because the Indians used it for tepee (or lodge)
poles. It is characterized by tall, slender, straight trunks, with most
of the foliage near the top. Its trunk is usually much smaller than
the other conifers of the region&mdash;seldom exceeding 20 inches. The
bark is much thinner than that of the ponderosa pine; gray scales on
the bark of young trees become brown with age. The cones are about
2 inches long and are borne in clusters of two or three, tightly attached
to the branch. Cones often remain on the tree for years, the seeds
retaining their vitality. After a light forest fire, the undamaged cones
will open, releasing the seeds. This is nature&rsquo;s way of reseeding a
fire-swept area and explains the extremely dense stands of lodgepole
pine which, for example, you will see near Many Parks Curve.</p>
<p><span class="small">ROCKY MOUNTAIN JUNIPER</span> can be seen on dry hills and rocky canyon
walls in the park. Its scalelike leaves (not needles) are small and
flattened against the innumerable branches. It has no cones, but bears
little, bluish berries, which require two seasons to ripen. Usually this
juniper grows in a squat and sprawling manner.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="597" />
<p class="pcap">Open stands of ponderosa pine are typical of the lower areas of the park.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The most common deciduous tree in the park is <span class="small">QUAKING ASPEN</span>. It
is immediately recognized by its smooth, white bark and small, green
leaves that tremble with the slightest breeze, because of the curious
flattening of the petiole, or leaf stalk, at right angles to the leaf blade.
Aspen grows to considerable size in beautiful groves of tall trees, where
the moisture and shelter are sufficient, but is more often seen in scrubby
thickets on rocky, drier slopes. In September the leaves turn to a
golden color, giving early autumn travelers a matchless visual experience.
<span class="small">NARROW-LEAF COTTONWOOD</span> grows along streams in the lower
altitudes of the park. Many willows also occupy streambank environments,
the most common being <span class="small">SCOULER WILLOW</span> with characteristic
willow leaves and large oval catkins, which are quite conspicuous in
May and early June.</p>
<p><span class="small">WATER BIRCH</span> is a thin-leaved, graceful shrub, sometimes growing to
tree size, commonly seen along streams in the lower forests. It can
be recognized by its graceful, almost delicate appearance. <span class="small">THINLEAF
ALDER</span>, also abundant along streams, often grows in great clumps with
many stems growing from the same root. Widespread throughout
the West, the alder provides habitat for many bird groups. You may
also recognize, by its leaf, <span class="small">ROCKY MOUNTAIN MAPLE</span>, which grows here
and there in the park up to about 11,000 feet.</p>
<p>The shrubs most commonly observed by the visitor are:</p>
<p><span class="small">ANTELOPE BITTERBRUSH</span>&mdash;a low, tough, much-branched shrub, with
many fragrant, pale-yellow blossoms in May and June. Its leaves are
less than 1 inch long, wedge-shaped and 3-toothed at the apex. The
spindle-shaped seeds are important food for chipmunks and ground
squirrels, and mule deer depend on the shrub for browse. <span class="small">BOULDER
RASPBERRY</span>&mdash;a common bush with showy, 5-petaled white blossoms, up
to 3 inches across. During May and June this shrub adds much beauty
to the landscape. Birds eat its berries avidly. <span class="small">WAX CURRANT</span>&mdash;a common
shrub found also in the highest forests&mdash;forms rounded clumps, 1
to 3 feet high, with rigid, much-branched stems and rounded leaves.
The red berries ripen in summer and are eaten by many birds and
small rodents. This plant is alternate host to blister rust (a disease
which may affect the limber pine in the park in the near future), and
much of it has been eradicated in areas where limber pine grows.
<span class="small">SAGEBRUSH</span>&mdash;a familiar plant in much of the West&mdash;in this park grows
in a dwarf form, and is common in Glacier Basin and on the southwest
slopes of Deer Mountain. This woody shrub, about 1 foot high, with
3-toothed, wedge-shaped, silvery leaves, is good forage for mule deer.</p>
<p>Conspicuous wildflowers that grow below 9,000 feet in the park and
that will attract attention in their blossoming season are:</p>
<p>Early in the season&mdash;as early as March&mdash;<span class="small">AMERICAN PASQUEFLOWER</span>
exhibits its large lavender blossoms as a sign of spring. As the season
advances, its blossoming follows the melting snow up the mountain
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
slopes, where it may be seen into July. This flower (without petals&mdash;the
sepals resemble petals&mdash;but with a golden center) looks somewhat
like the garden crocus. It is covered with silky hairs&mdash;almost &ldquo;fur-covered.&rdquo;
Another early-blooming flower is <span class="small">COMMON STARLILY</span>, often
called &ldquo;sandlily&rdquo;, which displays narrow grasslike leaves and white,
stemless flowers in early spring. It is rare in the park, but abundant
near the village of Estes Park during May.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="588" />
<p class="pcap">Sagebrush is one of the shrubs heavily browsed by mule deer.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="small">STEMLESS TOWNSENDIA</span>, locally called Easter-daisy, is another early
bloomer&mdash;most abundant in May. The inch-wide flower heads are
pale pink or white with yellow centers and are clustered on the crowns
of the plant. It is one of the composite family and is easily recognized
by the general similarity of the flower heads to those of the
larger, taller oxeye-daisy. The arnicas have several representatives
in the park region. An early-blooming variety is <span class="small">HEARTLEAF ARNICA</span>
which is common in the moist fields and open ponderosa pine forests
in May and June. It has large, yellow composite blossoms, from 2 to
3 inches across; the heart-shaped leaves are best developed at the base
of the stem. <span class="small">ROCKY MOUNTAIN IRIS</span> is common in meadows of this zone,
with its light-blue flower adding color to the &ldquo;parks&rdquo; of the region,
where moist conditions permit its growth. <span class="small">SPREADING THERMOPSIS</span>, or
&ldquo;golden banner,&rdquo; carpets the open areas with yellow during June and
July. This common plant is a pea, as its flowers suggest, and as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
long, flat seed pods prove. The flowers appear in clusters along the
top of the stem. <span class="small">PLAINS ERYSIMUM</span>, better known locally as &ldquo;western
wallflower,&rdquo; is also yellow, common, and conspicuous during June
and early July. Sometimes mistaken for golden banner by visitors
who drive rapidly past the meadows, it has quite a different flower pattern,
being a mustard with spikes of many small, 4-petaled flowers.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">Spreading pasqueflower heralds the arrival of spring.</p>
</div>
<p>As summer advances, other flowers become abundant. Penstemons
present their showy purple spikes of flowers during July. Most
abundant and conspicuous is <span class="small">ONESIDE PENSTEMON</span>, usually a foot or
more in height, which often colors the meadows blue. All penstemons
are easily recognized by their lobed, generally bell-shaped
flowers. The common name beardtongue is applied to certain species
which have a flattened and bearded sterile stamen on the inside of the
flower tube. This fifth sterile stamen, whether smooth or bearded,
is the source of the generic name <i>Penstemon</i>. <span class="small">LAMBERT CRAZYWEED</span>,
also known as &ldquo;Colorado locoweed,&rdquo; is abundant through July. It
can be recognized by its spike of reddish-purple blossoms and the
narrow, pinnately compound leaves. Curiously enough, locoweed
blooms twice during the summer, the August period of blossoming
being less noticeable. <span class="small">FREMONT GERANIUM</span>, or wild pink geranium, is
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
a lovely plant of the open pine forests, with typical 5-petaled pink
geranium blossoms. <span class="small">COMMON PERENNIAL GAILLARDIA</span> is a showy composite.
The flower heads are 2 to 3 inches across, with deep-maroon
to brownish centers and bright-yellow rays, often with dark bases.
The tips of these ray flowers have three distinct indentations, serving
to help distinguish this plant from <span class="small">BLACK-EYED-SUSAN</span>, which is also
common in the mountain meadows.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">

<p class="pcap">Gaillardia is one of the showiest composites.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="small">FIREWEED</span>, as its name suggests, commonly blooms on areas devastated
by forest fire or other destructive agencies. Its silky seeds are easily
carried by the wind to these areas, where it becomes dominant. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
blooms from early July into September, and the deep-pink, 4-petaled
flowers are borne in long, graceful spikes. It is a common roadside
plant. <span class="small">MINER&rsquo;S CANDLE</span> is a hairy-stemmed plant with innumerable
close-set clusters of small, white flowers throughout its stout, straight
stem. It also is common along roadsides.</p>
<p>Autumn flowers become increasingly abundant in late summer.
Conspicuous are the shrubby composites, including groundsels, sunflowers,
and purple asters. While the peak of the flower display comes
during July for this lower zone, many attractive wildflowers can be
seen until mid-September.</p>
<h3 id="c6">The Middle Belt</h3>
<p>Above an altitude of approximately 9,000 feet, the forests show a
different aspect. This is another zone, called the Subalpine by some
botanists and Canadian by others. It is characterized by forests of
stately <span class="small">ENGELMANN SPRUCE</span> and <span class="small">SUBALPINE FIR</span>. You can tell one from
the other by touching the needles. Spruce needles are 4-sided, rigid
to the touch, and sharp-pointed; fir needles are flattened and softer
to the touch. From your car, you can spot the firs by their erect, dark-colored
cones, mostly high in the tree. This type of forest is the
climax developed in this climatic belt, which receives twice as much
snow and rain as the zone below. This relatively abundant moisture
(much less, however, than in most of the Eastern States with their
broadleaf forests) supports a luxuriant conifer cover. Wildflower
gardens of rare beauty and startling luxuriance are found in natural
openings within the forest. The distinctive blue <span class="small">COLORADO COLUMBINE</span>,
which ranges from the lowest elevations up to 13,000 feet, seems to
reach its best development here.</p>
<p>Other plants of the open forests in this zone include <span class="small">WHITE GLOBE-FLOWER</span>
with its cream-colored, cup-shaped flower; <span class="small">COLUMBIA MONKSHOOD</span>,
with its helmeted blue or white flowers; <span class="small">ELKSLIP MARSH-MARIGOLD</span>,
with numerous oval white sepals often mistaken for petals; and
the strikingly beautiful <span class="small">PARRY PRIMROSE</span>, with clusters of brilliant purple
flowers, often growing along the edge of a stream. Common shrubs
include <span class="small">GREENES MOUNTAIN-ASH</span>, whose large clusters of white flowers
are replaced by bright red berries in autumn; <span class="small">BEARBERRY HONEYSUCKLE</span>,
better known in the Rockies as twinberry, a honeysuckle with large
ovate leaves 3 to 5 inches long and pairs of yellow flowers; and wild
<span class="small">AMERICAN RED RASPBERRY</span>, with prickly stems, 5-petaled white flowers,
and delicious red fruit, relished by birds and hikers alike.</p>
<p>In the cool, shadowed depths of the forest where light is dim, another
community of plants is found, including <span class="small">CALYPSO</span>, or &ldquo;fairy-slipper,&rdquo; a
dainty orchid with rose-colored blossoms formed in a curious slipperlike
shape; the <span class="small">PYROLAS</span>, a group of low, hardy perennial herbs with
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
white or pink flowers having 5 thick petals and 10 stamens; <span class="small">SPOTTED
CORALROOT</span>, a plant which, getting its nourishment from decaying vegetation,
has no green leaves, but bears purple-spotted flowers on its
brown stem; and <span class="small">AMERICAN TWINFLOWER</span>, a trailing plant of the honeysuckle
family, often forming dense mats with upright, forked flower
stems bearing a pair of pink, bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">

<p class="pcap">Blue columbine&mdash;Colorado&rsquo;s State flower.</p>
</div>
<p>After fire or other catastrophe wipes out the spruce-fir forests, a
cycle of natural revegetation must take place before the climax forest
again becomes established. The first step in this recovery process
is the appearance of fireweed and many annual herbs, among which
shrubs such as <span class="small">CLIFF JAMESIA</span>, or &ldquo;waxflower,&rdquo; become established, and
aspens begin to appear as succession plant types. They are replaced
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
eventually by longer-lived lodgepole pines, also sunloving and tolerant
of burned or denuded sites. The trees increase the wetness of the
forest floor, provide the shady sites necessary for seeds to grow in,
and shelter the young spruce and firs as they slowly increase and
approach maturity. Eventually, the spruces and firs crowd out the
pioneers which have helped them get established. This dense spruce-fir
forest seems to resist competition of other species and will maintain
itself indefinitely by gradual replenishment of its own kind, unless
it is again fire-swept or there is a change of climate. The spruce-fir
forests of the park seem to be as nearly fixed and static as forests
can be; or, in the scientists&rsquo; words, they are the <i>climax forest</i> for the
sites they occupy.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="579" />
<p class="pcap">Lodgepole pine forests along Trail Ridge Road.</p>
</div>
<p>The higher part of the Subalpine zone (10,500 to 11,500 feet) is
often called Hudsonian for its biological similarity to the region
around Hudson Bay. It is a sort of frontier zone where the climate
is more severe. Not only is it colder, but it is much windier, and
loss of water by evaporation is much greater than it is a thousand
feet lower. Although spruce and fir remain the dominant species,
they are usually shorter and less symmetrical in appearance. Near
the upper limits of this zone the trees are twisted and grotesque,
often flat and ground-hugging, sprawled behind boulders or fingering
into the dwarf willow clumps so characteristic of the alpine mountaintops.
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Here, also, the only 5-needle pine in the park, <span class="small">LIMBER PINE</span>,
a rocky-soil tree of the Subalpine zone, assumes its most picturesque
aspect. Limber pine at treeline is readily identified by its grotesque,
twisted, ragged appearance. Several splendid specimens can be seen
beside Trail Ridge Road about a half mile above Rainbow Curve.
The name, limber pine, comes from the ease with which the branches
can be bent without breaking. The cones are often 6 inches long,
the largest of any conifer in Colorado.</p>
<p>The limber pine stands in the shadow of threatened extermination
by blister rust. This fungus disease, which attacks, girdles, and destroys
all species of 5-needled pines, has wrought havoc in many parts
of the country. Like so many virulent forest diseases, it was introduced
from abroad. Since no known natural checks on it exist in this
country, it is almost impossible to eradicate. It spreads to pines only
from its alternate hosts, wax currant and other species of <i>Ribes</i>; if
these are eradicated from the vicinity, the pines can be preserved.
Though such control measures are costly, without them the limber
pine might be lost forever from the park. The Government has
been doing this work in selected forests on the northeast slope of
Longs Peak and near Estes Cone, where many splendid specimens
of this tree occur.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Above Treeline</h3>
<p>Above the Subalpine zone, whose upper limit is treeline, lies the
Alpine, or Arctic-Alpine, zone. This is the distinctive &ldquo;Land of
Lilliput&rdquo; of the plant kingdom, the alpine tundra, where nearly all
existing plant species are in dwarf form. Some of the zone is barren
rock, with only algae and lichen growth. Vast expanses of it, however,
are covered with a cold, wet soil mantle which, during the
brief summertime, presents a myriad of low, cushionlike flower
clumps. Sometimes&mdash;usually through July&mdash;the effect is that of a
vast carpet of flowers. The list of plant species is great. Showiest
of the alpine flowers are <span class="small">ALPINE BUTTERCUP</span>, with large, yellow, poppylike
flowers, often blooming at the very edges of snowbanks; <span class="small">ALPINE
FORGET-ME-NOT</span>, which grows in dense, low clumps and presents thick
patches of bright-blue flowers; <span class="small">MOSS SILENE</span> (&ldquo;moss campion&rdquo;), a mosslike
cushion plant with pink flowers (also found in Greenland and
Alaska); <span class="small">GRAYLOCKS ACTINEA</span>, sometimes called &ldquo;Old Man of the Mountain,&rdquo;
with bright-yellow flower heads, usually wind-blown and ragged,
almost as broad as the plant is tall; <span class="small">TUFTED PHLOX</span>, better known
here as &ldquo;alpine phlox,&rdquo; the cushion of which is sometimes entirely
covered with pale-blue or white flowers; <span class="small">AMERICAN BISTORT</span>, with dense
spikes of tiny flowers standing like miniature bottle brushes above
the tundra grasses; <span class="small">KINGS CROWN</span>, a fleshy plant with dark-red blossoms,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
the whole plant often turning completely red in late summer; and
<span class="small">MT. WASHINGTON DRYAD</span>, with its curious 8-petaled, cream-colored
flowers.</p>

<p class="pcap">Limber pine at treeline.</p>
</div>
<p>Tundra is characteristically composed of grasses, sedges, herbs, and
a few dwarfed shrubs. Many lichens and mosses also grow in tundra.
The plants are typically small, low-growing, and compact, and often
have showy flowers. There seems to be an abundance of blossoms
in proportion to the size and amount of foliage of the plants. Their
small leaves are protected from excessive water loss by masses of hairs
or waxy substances, and they frequently contain high amounts of
red pigment. Most of these plants are exceedingly slow-growing;
some of those you see may be a hundred to several thousand years old.</p>
<p>The story of the park&rsquo;s trees and flowers is intensely interesting,
but can best be understood by more careful study than is possible
in this booklet. Several excellent botanical bulletins are available,
and we urge you to invest in one of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">ANIMAL LIFE</span></h2>
<p>A National Park is a spacious natural reserve, and in it those creatures
that have survived through the past are protected from harm
by humans. They are not protected from each other, there being
no attempt to change natural relationships of predator and prey.</p>
<p>Since the animals are in their natural habitats, and not in cages,
you may not be able to see at close range the kinds of animals you
may want to see at any time you like. Instead, you must expect to
see them at their convenience, not yours. This requires careful,
patient watching, but the rewards are great for the observant outdoorsman.
An occasional glimpse of a bull elk grazing free in his
native meadow may be more satisfying than the most detailed inspection
of a confined creature in a zoological garden. Our society needs
both types of experiences.</p>
<p>Although there are about 35 species of mammals in the park, this
booklet can present brief descriptions of only a few of those likely to
be of greatest interest.</p>

<h3 id="c9">Hoofed Mammals</h3>
<p>The largest mammal of Rocky Mountain National Park is the <span class="small">AMERICAN
ELK</span>, or &ldquo;wapiti.&rdquo; It is really a big deer&mdash;distinctly larger than
the local mule deer and usually with a more reddish or brownish coat.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
The true American representative of the Old World elks is the moose,
not found in Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
<p>American elk were almost exterminated here by ruthless hunting in
prepark days. Seventy animals introduced here in 1913 and 1914 from
Yellowstone National Park made possible the present population of
over 600 elk in this park.</p>
<p>During summer, the elk are usually high in the mountains, feeding
on the lush grass of the widespread tundra and the forest glades.
Their food consists mostly of grass, herbs, and twigs of woody plants.
The summer is a short but prosperous time for these animals. Usually
by early autumn, fierce storms in the high country put an end to days
of ample forage, and most of the elk move down into the small meadows
at lower altitudes. In late September, as the mating season begins
and the bulls fight for possession of the herds, large groups of elk can
be seen in such places as Horseshoe Park and Beaver Meadows. This
is when the bugling challenges of the bulls can be heard echoing
across the valleys. In November, this period ends and the more prosaic
struggle for survival on the limited winter range begins.</p>
<p>Formerly, during winter, the elk could scatter well below the present
site of Estes Park village; now they are &ldquo;bottled up&rdquo; within the park
meadows, because of the encircling human developments. Or perhaps
these introduced elk and their descendants never developed a more
extensive winter migration pattern, for the more venturesome individuals
among them would have been killed or harried by hunters in
the lower country east of the park. In any case, most of them do not
move out of the park.</p>
<p>Times are hard for the elk until spring permits their return to the
high country, where ample feed awaits them. Grave concern is felt
by wildlife experts about the winter food shortages confronting this
species. Without deliberate control by the park rangers, in order to
keep the population at a level that can be supported by the limited
and overused vegetation of the park&rsquo;s winter ranges, the herd itself
would face mass starvation. The absence or near disappearance from
this region of some of the most effective predators of the elk&mdash;cougar,
wolf, and grizzly&mdash;has removed most of the aboriginal population
controls.</p>
<p>Whether you visit the park in summer or winter, you should be
able to see elk&mdash;at least with binoculars. In summer (especially in
the evenings) you may see them along Trail Ridge Road, emerging
from the forests below Fall River Pass or the Rock Cut area. The
cirque below Fall River Pass is a good place to look for them with
binoculars. From mid-September until March or April, herds of
elk are normally to be seen in Beaver Meadows, Horseshoe Park,
Moraine Park, and in the meadows north of Grant Lake; but patience
and some keenness of observation are required.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="631" />
<p class="pcap">Although elk, especially the bulls, occasionally stay high in the deep-snow belt,
most of them feed in lower meadows during winter.</p>
</div>
<p>It should be easier to find <span class="small">MULE DEER</span>, a familiar sight in many
areas in early morning or evening, even in midsummer. Hikers encounter
them on the trails throughout the park. When startled, the
mule deer takes flight, characteristically bounding from all four feet
at once, making soaring leaps, and landing with such force that
its feet make a drumming sound. This bouncing but graceful gait
has earned it the nickname &ldquo;jumping deer&rdquo; in some areas. It is effective
in ascending rocky slopes and traversing brush country.</p>
<p>The males of all deer, including the American elk, grow antlers
annually. For a short period in late winter and spring they have
no antlers at all, but by June the new growths begin, getting larger
and larger until August, when they attain full size. Until then,
the antlers are &ldquo;in velvet&rdquo;&mdash;with a soft, hairy covering&mdash;which dries
up and peels or is rubbed off. Often the animal helps the removal
of the velvet by rubbing its antlers against the trunks and branches
of trees. Many &ldquo;rubbing trees&rdquo; can be seen along the trails. The
deer enter the mating season with polished, full-sized antlers, and
these majestic adornments are worn until the season of shedding.
One might expect to see discarded antlers everywhere; but because
they contain much salt and calcium they are eaten by porcupines
and other rodents. Few shed antlers, therefore, are seen by visitors to
the park.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>In summer, mule deer are seen singly or in small groups, browsing
in the higher country; like the elk, they descend into the lower
meadows in autumn. They, too, find the winter difficult, because
of limited range. Deer are browsing animals, eating such things as
willow, aspen, antelope bitterbrush, and even pine needles. Much
of their natural food has been overbrowsed, and this condition has
helped to make beggars of many of them. It is not unusual to see
them in the streets of Estes Park village or near the town garbage
dump looking for food. June, however, brings the lush green vegetation
on which they regain their strength. That month also is fawning
time. The spotted fawns are usually hidden in the woods and
are nursed twice a day by the mother, who stays nearby but out of
sight. Sometimes well-meaning visitors report an abandoned baby
deer. In most instances, the fawn has not been abandoned; the visitors
simply failed to see the mother in the background. Fawns, which
keep their spots until autumn, run with the mother until the next
spring.</p>
<p>The greatest thrill for many park visitors is when a <span class="small">BIGHORN</span>, or mountain
sheep, comes close enough to be photographed; however, those
occasions are rare. Like most large mammals of the West, the bighorn
was on the verge of extinction 40 years ago, but, thanks to various
conservation measures, it is now well established. Formerly, bighorn
were distributed throughout the park and beyond to the foothills.
Today, they are largely restricted, by man&rsquo;s necessary settlement of
the land, to portions of the park remote from man&rsquo;s developments.
Most visitors&mdash;when they get to see them at all&mdash;spot bighorn on Trail
Ridge Road near Milner Pass (on Specimen Mountain) or in the
Mummy Range. They are seen now and then near Sheep Lake (in
Horseshoe Park), usually in small family groups of ewes and lambs.
Successful pictures of them have been made mostly in this vicinity.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Predatory Mammals</h3>
<p>Yellowstone and Yosemite are two National Parks where visitors
have ample opportunity to become acquainted with the <span class="small">BLACK BEAR</span>.
Many people, by foolishly feeding or petting these wild animals, have
become too intimately acquainted, and have been injured in the process.
Here in Rocky Mountain National Park, these opportunities
seldom occur, for the bear population is low. If you are lucky enough
to see one of these bulky, furry creatures lumbering along the road, do
not try to fraternize with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="900" />
<p class="pcap">Brown bear are present in the park, but not in large numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Although the species present here is called the black bear, there are
blonds among them, too. The brown bear and cinnamon bear are
merely color phases of the black bear. Bears eat almost everything,
including roots, berries, ants, frogs, fish, carrion, and such small mammals
or birds as get into their clutches. They seem to be particularly
voracious in eating garbage&mdash;discarded lunches, bacon, and similar
material likely to be present in a campground. The bear is a relatively
solitary animal. He has poor eyesight, but good hearing and
sense of smell. Bears usually hibernate in fitful sleep, living off
stored-up layers of body fat. The surprisingly small, squirrel-sized
young are born in February during this semihibernation. The mother
gives devoted care to her cubs, and defends them vigorously.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see grizzlies here, for they were extirpated from this region
before the park was established.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">COUGAR</span> has many aliases&mdash;mountain lion, catamount, painter,
panther, puma&mdash;depending upon the locality. Almost 9 feet long
including the 3-foot tail, the adult cougar may weigh over 200 pounds.
Its coat is dull, yellowish brown; immature cougars have blackish
spots. It has acute powers of sight, smell, and hearing. A sly, crafty,
and tireless hunter, it is not often seen by man even where it is abundant.
The cougar is part of the natural wildlife community, and is
protected from hunters within park boundaries. The chances of seeing
one here are remote, for many who have spent a lifetime in these
mountains have never reported seeing one. A few observations of
these animals, however, are usually reported in the park each year.</p>
<p>A much smaller cat occasionally seen in the park is the <span class="small">BOBCAT</span>. It
roams the forested areas of the park principally hunting small rodents
and rabbits. Grouse also are taken, and on forays above treeline the
bobcat may feed upon ptarmigan. It lives in dens in the rocks and
sometimes in a hollow tree. Like the snowshoe rabbit upon which it
preys, the bobcat has natural &ldquo;snowshoes&rdquo;&mdash;its feet are expanded in
winter by long hairs, which help support the animal on the snow.</p>
<p>A close cousin to the domestic dog is the <span class="small">COYOTE</span>. This exceedingly
cunning animal is actually extending its range, despite man&rsquo;s attempts
to wipe it out, and is very common in the park. Few people fail to
thrill upon first hearing its song&mdash;a high, staccato yipping often
heard by visitors as they leave the evening talks at Moraine Park.
You can expect to see coyotes almost anywhere in the park; early
morning is a good time to look for them in the grassy meadows.</p>
<p>Another member of the dog family, the <span class="small">RED FOX</span>, is seen occasionally
by visitors. It is notoriously wary and cunning, and although less
fleet-footed than the jackrabbit, it is faster than the coyote. Its family
life meets with our approval, for the male actually feeds the female
during the lying-in period, and at the risk of its own life leads hunters
away from the den and its helpless occupants. It eats almost anything;
small rodents are preferred.</p>
<p>People often bring back tales of an unusual animal on the trail above
Bear Lake. Usually, they have seen the <span class="small">MARTEN</span>, the largest of our
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
remaining local weasels and an altogether interesting animal. This
creature is at home in the treetops or on the forest floor. Like all
weasels, it is a voracious feeder and a peril to its neighbors. It successfully
hunts birds and squirrels in the trees, and preys on rats, rabbits,
fish, grouse, frogs, insects, and other weasels. Its repertory of
sounds includes hisses, squalls, barks, growls, and shrieks. It breeds in
summer, but the young are not born until the following spring; its
life span is about 18 years. It is closely related to the famous Russian
sable, and has been nearly exterminated by trapping through most of
its original range.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="628" />
<p class="pcap">Young martens show the curiosity typical of their kind.</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="small">MINK</span> is rare in the park, but is occasionally seen on Glacier
Creek. This member of the weasel family is an excellent swimmer,
and catches fish with ease. Its dense and oily fur keeps it warm in
cold water, but it lacks any other apparent adaptations to an aquatic
life. So agile an animal has few natural enemies apart from disease;
its most important predator is, oddly enough, the great horned owl.
The young are born blind and helpless, and only the size of one&rsquo;s
finger, but by summer&rsquo;s end they become self-sufficient.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">WEASEL</span> is a small, sharp-eyed creature with an extremely long
body, small triangular head, and furtive ways. Weasels are successful
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
hunters, searching through brush piles and rock heaps and in
underground burrows for rodents of all kinds. There are two species
in the park&mdash;the <span class="small">LONGTAIL WEASEL</span> and the <span class="small">SHORTTAIL WEASEL</span>, or
<span class="small">ERMINE</span>. The latter is less than half as large as the former. Like
that of certain other mountain dwellers, the fur of weasels becomes
white as the snows of winter approach, replacing the brown of summer.</p>
<p>Horseback riders crossing Moraine Park and Beaver Meadows are
usually wary of the large holes that are the work of the <span class="small">BADGER</span>. Although
a creature of the plains rather than of the mountains, the
badger lives in some of the lower meadows of the park, and there
have been reports of badgers being seen near Fall River Pass. It is a
meat eater, and its large front feet have long claws, which enable
it speedily to dig out a ground squirrel.</p>

<h3 id="c11">Gnawing Mammals</h3>
<p>The <span class="small">YELLOWBELLY MARMOT</span>, with its reddish underparts, grizzled
back, and bushy tail, is seen by nearly all park visitors. Although
it is more common in medium altitudes in the mountains, it also
may be seen high along Trail Ridge Road, and a pair, reportedly, is
living atop Longs Peak! These rodents live in dens, usually rockpiles,
into which they pack twigs and grass to make a comfortable
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
nest. They store up a heavy layer of fat in the summer and hibernate
during the cold winter. Their natural food consists of grasses, berries,
and roots. Their short, sharp whistle can be heard a mile away.
During the summer, hikers occasionally see rather humanlike scenes,
as marmot families sun themselves on the &ldquo;front porches&rdquo; of their
rockpile homes.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">TASSEL-EARED</span>, or <span class="small">ABERT</span>, <span class="small">SQUIRREL</span> is an excellent example of
the zonal specialization of mammals. It is almost entirely restricted
to the ponderosa pine forest belt. Its showy ear tufts, although often
absent during the summer, set it apart from other local squirrels.
It feeds mostly on ponderosa pine seeds, the bark of twigs and young
trees of this species, and such wild fruits and succulent vegetation as
are available. The Abert squirrel builds nests in the trees and is a
familiar sight to hikers in the ponderosa pine forests. It is usually
gray-colored, but may be brown or even completely black.</p>
<p>Another small arboreal rodent, the <span class="small">SPRUCE SQUIRREL</span>, chatters and
scolds when a stranger enters its patch of forest. It roams both the
lodgepole pine and higher spruce-fir forests with their bitter winters,
yet it does not hibernate. Even after the most severe storms it will
emerge to travel through the treetop world it occupies. Some bird
enthusiasts have little regard for it, because of its habit of eating eggs
and young birds whenever the opportunity presents itself. However,
in a National Park the squirrel&rsquo;s desire to live is considered to be as
important as is the bird&rsquo;s. A certain &ldquo;balance&rdquo; of population is the
result, which is, after all, one of the desirable features in an area dedicated
to preserving natural conditions.</p>
<p><span class="small">CHIPMUNKS</span> are particularly familiar at Trail Ridge Road parking
areas. These small squirrels are reddish-brown above, with white
underparts and with four white stripes running along the back. A
definite stripe across the face distinguishes them from the golden-mantled
ground squirrels, with which they are often found.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">GOLDEN-MANTLED GROUND SQUIRREL</span> is often confused with the
smaller chipmunks which it joins in begging for visitor handouts at
parking areas below treeline on Trail Ridge Road. Its natural food
is succulent plant material and seeds, but many of the gregarious little
animals are becoming more or less dependent upon food offered them
by humans. You can see them most conveniently at Many Parks
Curve.</p>
<p>Another little rodent, common in the lower meadows, is the <span class="small">RICHARDSON
GROUND SQUIRREL</span> (&ldquo;picket pin&rdquo;). It lives in colonies, after the
fashion of the prairie dog of the plains. It is abundant in Moraine
Park.</p>
<p>Relatively few park visitors see the <span class="small">BEAVER</span>; but all can see examples
of its work. It works at night as a rule, and usually remains out of
sight when humans are abroad. These industrious rodents are much
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
larger than the related chipmunks and marmots, and weigh as much
as 90 pounds. Beaver pelts were part of the lure that led to the early
exploration of the West. Almost exterminated about 50 years ago,
they are now relatively abundant in Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">

<p class="pcap">Yellowbelly marmot&mdash;seen by most visitors.</p>
</div>
<p>The beaver is well adapted to its water environment. The hindlegs
are webbed for efficient swimming; the tail, broad and horizontally
flattened, helps in underwater maneuvering. However, its swimming
speed at the surface of the water is only about 2 miles per hour. Beaver
can remain submerged for over 5 minutes; this ability helps in
escaping enemies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="663" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">The beaver is sometimes seen by alert observers in late afternoon or
early morning.</p>
</div>
<p>Beaver dams are abundant in the park. Many typical examples
can be seen in Horseshoe Park, Moraine Park, Glacier Basin, and
Hidden Valley, and along the Colorado River. Nearly all of the park
trails pass beaver workings. The dams are built of various materials
in this region, but most commonly of mud, parts of aspens, and
debris. They are started from the upstream side&mdash;usually on shallow
creeks&mdash;and as the water level rises so does the dam. The beaver
uses its front paws almost as hands. The load of mud or sticks
sometimes is carried by being pressed against the chest as the animal
walks on its hind feet to the top of the structure it is building. The
dam is made to create a stabilized water level. This is essential for
protection of the beaver&rsquo;s island den&mdash;a lodge made of sticks and
mud. The beaver house starts as a solid heap of debris, but the
animal chews and digs out a couple of underwater tunnels, as well
as one or more dome-shaped rooms with the floor a few inches
above water level. In this dry retreat the beaver rests, sleeps, and
rears its family. Few natural enemies can pursue it through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
underwater entrances. Its food is chiefly aspen bark and twigs. A
winter supply is stored under water during late summer.</p>
<p>Because of its energy, skill, and persistence, the beaver has become
a symbol of industriousness. It is also often credited with more intelligence
than it probably possesses. Its apparent industry and
resourcefulness are due more likely to inherited instincts than to reasoning.
At any rate, this large rodent is surely one of the most
interesting animals in the park.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/p20a.jpg" alt="" width="734" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">A narrow tail distinguishes the muskrat from the beaver, which may live in
the same locality.</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="small">MUSKRAT</span> is frequently active in daylight hours. It lives in
the same environment as the beaver, but in the park has a much
more limited distribution and is confined to lower elevations. It builds
lodges, too; they are much smaller than those of the beaver, and are
largely composed of mud and plant material. The lodge serves as
a secondary food source in the winter, and many muskrat houses are
practically eaten away by spring. Unlike the beaver, a strict vegetarian,
the muskrat eats fish, insects, and any birds it can catch, as
well as plant food. This animal has not acquired the ability to build
dams, but does make rafts of sticks and twigs. When seen closely, a
muskrat is easily distinguished from a beaver, for it is smaller and
has a slender, vertically flattened tail, quite unlike that of the beaver.</p>
<p>Probably everyone recognizes the <span class="small">PORCUPINE</span>. It is a large, short-legged
rodent, rather clumsy of behavior, and usually seen either sleeping
or leisurely chewing the bark of a tree. The porcupine survives,
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
despite its sluggish behavior, because of the protection afforded by
some 30,000 quills in its pelage. Although it cannot &ldquo;throw&rdquo; these
quills, they are very loosely attached, and when the tail is vigorously
thrashed about it is inevitable that some of the quills become detached
and fall away. The unlucky recipient of such a slap of the tail will
be convinced that the quills were thrown, although the effective embedding
of quills is done by direct contact.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">MOUNTAIN COTTONTAIL</span> is often seen in the lower forests. Despite
heavy predation by many natural enemies, the cottontail manages
to maintain itself because of its high birth rate. One mother may
produce a total of 25 young in the 4 or 5 litters born during the year.
It is fairly small, grayish-brown in color, with rather short ears and a
conspicuous cottony tail resembling a powder puff. It lives in underground
burrows and retains the same color winter and summer.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">SNOWSHOE HARE</span> nests on the surface of the ground. Its fur
changes from grayish-brown in summer to white in winter. A denizen
of the spruce-fir and lodgepole pine forests and of the tundra, it
hops about the snow on its huge, furry, &ldquo;snowshoe&rdquo; feet, apparently
finding the severe winters of the high country no great hardship. It
is not common in the park, and therefore is not often seen.</p>

</div>
<p>Motorists on the highest parts of the Trail Ridge Road often see the
<span class="small">PIKA</span>, which looks like a small, grayish guinea pig but is really a close
relative of the rabbit. It is found in the rock slides and talus piles in
the high country mostly above treeline, and is seldom seen below 9,000
feet. Despite the subzero temperature of the tundra belt, it does not
hibernate. Its habit of storing little bundles of mountain grasses and
other alpine plants has given it the nickname of &ldquo;alpine haymaker&rdquo;;
it is also sometimes called &ldquo;cony&rdquo;&mdash;a name better reserved for an unrelated
Old World mammal. Look for the pika at Rock Cut on Trail
Ridge Road, it seems to have favorite sunning spots from which it
greets the traveler with shrill shrieks.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Coldblooded Vertebrates</h3>
<p>Many animals do not possess an adequate mechanism for maintenance
of constant body heat. Some of these, taking advantage of the
slowness with which water changes temperature, live mostly in an
aquatic environment. Few can endure the cold winters of high
altitudes.</p>
<p>Unlike other animals in National Parks, fish may be taken, under
regulations designed to conserve the resource. As long as you have a
State fishing license, you may exercise this privilege in Rocky Mountain
National Park. The season and catch limits vary from year to
year; you are urged to ask a park ranger about current regulations.</p>

<p>The original trout in the park is the <span class="small">BLACK-SPOTTED</span>, or <span class="small">CUTTHROAT</span>,
<span class="small">TROUT</span>. Once found only in the northern Rockies, it has been transplanted
widely. It has numerous subspecies and color variations, but
here it is usually an olive-green on back and upper sides, shading into
a yellowish cast on lower sides. The lower surface becomes red at
spawning time. The body and fins are black-spotted. The red streak
on each side of the lower jaw has given it the name &ldquo;cutthroat.&rdquo; Its
principal foods are insects and small aquatic animals. Spawning
takes place in midsummer in the high country.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">BROOK TROUT</span>, originally native east of the Mississippi, was introduced
into this park, where it has thrived and maintains itself through
natural reproduction in many lakes and streams. It is olive-green to
gray, with a sprinkling of red and gray spots on the sides. The front
borders of the lower fins and the lower borders of the tail are white.
Its food includes insects, worms, small minnows, and crustaceans. It
spawns in autumn; the female deposits the eggs in a depression she
scoops out in the streambed. After the eggs are fertilized, she covers
them with gravel and leaves them to hatch unattended.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">RAINBOW TROUT</span> is another nonnative trout of the park waters.
Its original range was on the Pacific slope of the Sierras and the Cascades,
but it has been transplanted widely. It is bluish-olive above the
lateral line, changing to silvery-green on the sides. Its name is derived
from a broad, reddish stripe on the sides. It eats insects, worms, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
smaller fishes, and is a favorite of the angler for its fighting ability
and tendency to break water when hooked. Spawning occurs from
autumn to spring, depending on the altitude.</p>

<p class="pcap">Cutthroat trout.</p>
</div>
<p>The most common amphibian in the park is the bright-green to
tan <span class="small">LEOPARD FROG</span>. Restricted to damp areas near ponds or creeks,
it is most likely to be seen in spring and early summer when the
gelatinous egg masses are being laid. The tadpoles develop into
mature frogs in about 3 years. Until then, it lives on plant food;
after maturity, it eats insects and worms. It is found in Moraine Park,
Horseshoe Park, and other moist grassland valleys.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">THREE-LINED TREEFROG</span>, our smallest amphibian&mdash;about an inch
long&mdash;is often mistaken for a young leopard frog. Although it is a
treefrog, possessing disks on its toes, it is seldom seen in trees; it
prefers small ponds or swampy grassland. It is sometimes found
under rockpiles or pieces of damp wood. Despite its small size, its
loud chirps in spring and summer can be heard a half mile away.
During its singing, a vocal sac beneath the lower jaw inflates to a
size larger than the creatures head. It is easily recognized by the
three stripes down its back. Look for this diminutive amphibian
at Gem Lake.</p>
<p>The insectivorous <span class="small">MOUNTAIN TOAD</span>, a nondescript denizen of marshy
lake habitats, is common in Cub Lake Valley, Hallowell Park, and
in the Ouzel Lake area in Wild Basin. In late spring, large numbers
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
congregate in ponds to lay strings of eggs. The small tadpoles become
adults by the end of summer.</p>

<p class="pcap">View of Mount Ypsilon from near Bear Meadows approach to Trail Ridge Road.</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="small">TIGER SALAMANDER</span> is one of the oddest animals of the park.
Salamanders do not walk out of fires, as medieval tradition had it,
but are amphibians. Unlike frogs and toads however, they retain
their tails after reaching maturity. They hatch from eggs in shallow
ponds, breathe by means of feathery external gills at the back of the
head. Later, the gills are absorbed and the salamander begins breathing
with lungs; it then leaves the water for a moist underground
burrow, returning to ponds in early spring to lay eggs on plants or
debris in the water near the shore. In southern latitudes, the larvae
(gill-breathing forms) are able to lay eggs; these are the <i>axolotls</i> of
Mexico. Our local variety of the tiger salamander is about 8 inches
long, gray-brown with dark spots. It is found in Sheep Lake, around
which large numbers occur during the spawning season in June, and
is often seen in suitable habitats along Cub Lake Trail. It eats insects,
insect larvae, worms, and small snails. It is harmless to humans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The only reptile in the park is the <span class="small">MOUNTAIN GARTER SNAKE</span>, which
is found throughout the mountainous areas of Colorado. Because of
its fondness for water, it is often erroneously called a &ldquo;water snake.&rdquo;
It is greenish-gray and may reach a length of over 2 feet. It feeds on
frogs and worms; it is entirely harmless to man, but is capable of
giving off an offensive odor when handled. The young are born alive
in midsummer. These snakes may be seen near most of the marshy
ponds or slow-moving streams in the park. The ponds in Cub Lake
Valley and in Hallowell Park are favorite haunts of these interesting
creatures.</p>
<p>No rattlesnakes or other poisonous reptiles have ever been found in
the park. Reports of rattlesnakes near Glen Haven mark the highest
known occurrences in this region&mdash;a fact that, while contributing to
the visitor&rsquo;s peace of mind, puzzles many people. This absence, or
relative scarcity, of cold-blooded animals is probably due to the climate&mdash;long,
cold winters and chilly summer evenings. The lower
amount of oxygen at high altitudes may also be a factor. On the
tundra, many pools are free of ice for only about 6 weeks&mdash;scarcely
time for frogs&rsquo; eggs to hatch and for larvae to develop lungs before
freeze-up. The cold nights, even in midsummer, would inhibit a large
snake&rsquo;s movements to such a degree that it would probably starve.
Thus you can hike in the park in confidence that you will encounter
no poisonous snakes.</p>

<h3 id="c13">Birds</h3>
<p>With over 226 different species listed in the most recent publication
on local birds, it is difficult to give adequate attention to the subject
in the limited space of this booklet. Park birds, like our human population,
can be classified as visitors and residents. Occasionally a
&ldquo;straggler&rdquo; appears, far from its usual haunts. Birds, like humans,
can be further classified by their preferences as to locale. Just as some
people prefer to visit the high peaks and tundras, so some birds prefer
these areas. A few people come here only to fish; so does the belted
kingfisher. Like most humans, many birds can be seen throughout
the park, and the greatest variety and numbers occur in summer.</p>
<p>A number of park birds&mdash;both resident and migratory&mdash;have specific
preferences. For instance, if a bird&rsquo;s diet is mostly seeds from pine
cones, it will usually be found in pine forests. Typical park environments
and the characteristic birdlife of zones are outlined in Appendix
B. Most of the birds nest in these associations.</p>
<p>The lower altitudes of the park&mdash;ponderosa pine forests and grassy
meadows&mdash;have a large, varied population of birds in summer. Here
lives the <span class="small">STELLER&rsquo;S JAY</span>, easily recognized by its rich-blue wings, sharp
crest, and saucy manner. The <span class="small">BLACK-BILLED MAGPIE</span>, like Steller&rsquo;s jay
a member of the crow family, has a conspicuously long tail, a greenish-iridescent,
black-and-white body, and a propensity for scavenging
small animals killed by autos. The <span class="small">WILLIAMSON&rsquo;S SAPSUCKER</span> is always
associated with the ponderosa pine in which it pecks its sap holes; and
the &ldquo;red-naped sapsucker&rdquo;&mdash;a subspecies of the <span class="small">YELLOW-BELLIED SAPSUCKER</span>&mdash;with
bright-red throat and crown, is usually seen working
on aspens. The <span class="small">GREEN-TAILED TOWHEE</span> nests in the shrubs of the Montane
zone during June. <span class="small">RED-EYED VIREOS</span>, characterized by gray cap
and black-bordered white stripe over the eye, are found in the forested
valleys from June into August. The <span class="small">PIGMY NUTHATCH</span>, a tiny, noisy
bird with a brown head and white underparts, wanders in small, noisy
flocks through the pine forests in spring and autumn but scatters during
the nesting season. There is some migration of pigmy nuthatches
to the plains when winter comes.</p>
<p>The chickadees&mdash;both the <span class="small">MOUNTAIN CHICKADEE</span>, which remains in
the park during the winter and has a typical black cap, broken by
a white line above the eye, and the <span class="small">BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEE</span>, which
becomes scarce in the winter&mdash;belong to the Montane zone. The
<span class="small">VIOLET-GREEN SWALLOW</span> is an abundant species in this zone. The
<span class="small">MOUNTAIN BLUEBIRD</span> arrives in &ldquo;waves&rdquo; during April, to leave scattered
pairs to nest in holes in aspens or other cavities. It lacks the rufous
breast, but has the characteristic azure color its name suggests. The
<span class="small">WESTERN TANAGER</span>, the most colorful bird in the park, is mainly black
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
and yellow, with a red face. It is in the park from mid-May until
August.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">

<p class="pcap">The gray jay, or &ldquo;camp robber,&rdquo; which often visits motorists during lunch stops.</p>
</div>
<p>Nesting in this general zone, in rocky cliffs and canyons, are the
<span class="small">GOLDEN EAGLE</span> (seen every summer); the <span class="small">CANYON WREN</span> (its characteristic
&ldquo;laughing&rdquo; song is often heard during May and June); and the
<span class="small">WHITE-THROATED SWIFT</span> (which comes in early May to nest in crannies
in the cliffs at the very east edge of the park, and leaves in June).</p>
<p>Some birds commonly nest in lodgepole and aspen forests, from
about 8,500 feet upward. They include the <span class="small">WESTERN WOOD PEWEE</span>,
with a dark gray back, dull gray underparts, and two white bars on
the long wings; the <span class="small">WARBLING VIREO</span>, a migrant that arrives in a &ldquo;wave&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
late in May; the <span class="small">LINCOLN&rsquo;S SPARROW</span>, streaked, with a short tail, which
spends only 2 months in the park; the <span class="small">RUBY-CROWNED KINGLET</span>, which
appears suddenly in late April and fills the forests with its song during
June; the showy <span class="small">AUDUBON&rsquo;S WARBLER</span>, with its fire-bright yellow spots
and white wing patches; and the <span class="small">HERMIT THRUSH</span>, whose songs ring
through the lodgepole and spruce-fir forests and along the streams in
July.</p>
<p>In the spruce-fir forest, nesting birds you may expect to see include
the <span class="small">PINE GROSBEAK</span>, a large finch, the male of which has a rich rose-red
head and breast; and the <span class="small">BROWN CREEPER</span>, named for its habit of creeping
up tree trunks. Thickets near treeline are the nesting area of the
<span class="small">WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW</span>, a bird with strikingly black-and-white
striped crown. It is as much at home above treeline as below, usually
ready to scold all hikers who invade its territory. The <span class="small">WILSON&rsquo;S
WARBLER</span>, with yellow body and black cap, nests in the willows at
this altitude, but leaves the heights in August and returns in May.</p>
<p>Above the forests, on the wind-swept tundra, are some of the most
interesting birds of the park. Here <span class="small">WHITE-TAILED PTARMIGANS</span> spend
the entire year. These alpine grouse, mottled-brown in summer, become
pure white in midwinter. They assemble in small flocks in
September to spend the winter together, but disperse during May and
June for courtship and breeding. Nesting ptarmigans have been seen
close by the busy Trail Ridge Road. Depending upon their natural
camouflage for protection, they seldom show alarm when closely
approached.</p>
<p>Ornithologists travel far to see <span class="small">BROWN-CAPPED ROSY FINCHES</span>, which
breed only on the high mountains of Colorado and probably northern
New Mexico. Nesting in cliffs above treeline in summer, they band
together in autumn to descend into the ponderosa forests for the winter.
A third common bird of the tundra is the <span class="small">WATER PIPIT</span>, a small
ground bird, whose white-bordered tail is almost constantly in wagging
motion. Pipits have an interesting courtship flight, and during
midsummer are seen only above treeline, where they nest. By late
August they descend to lower altitudes, not to return until June.</p>
<p>Even the most casual visitor notices the <span class="small">GRAY JAY</span> and its cousin,
<span class="small">CLARK&rsquo;S NUTCRACKER</span>. These members of the crow family are common
at Bear Lake and at Many Parks and Rainbow Curve parking areas on
Trail Ridge Road, where they compete with the chipmunks for hand-outs
from motorists. The <span class="small">GRAY JAY</span>, sometimes known as the Rocky
Mountain jay or &ldquo;camp robber,&rdquo; has a dull-gray body, light-gray head,
and short bill. It is often seen in the company of the Clark&rsquo;s nutcracker,
about the same size, but with a longer bill, light-gray body
and white patches on black wings and tail. The nutcracker tends to
range both above treeline and down into the ponderosa pine belt
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
during summer, whereas the &ldquo;camp robber&rdquo; has a more restricted
distribution.</p>

<p class="pcap">The ptarmigan&rsquo;s summer coat resembles lichen-covered boulders of the high
meadows where it lives.</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="small">COMMON RAVEN</span> is often observed soaring over the canyons.
<span class="small">RED-TAILED HAWKS</span> are fairly common&mdash;those that nest on the cliffs
southeast of the visitor center are almost always to be seen in summer
in Moraine Park. The robin is abundant and widely distributed in
the park in summer. Flocks of robins are to be seen above treeline
into October. The sleek <span class="small">BOHEMIAN WAXWING</span> passes through the park
in winter and early spring. Along the beaver ponds, in the willows,
the showy <span class="small">REDWINGED BLACKBIRD</span> may be seen from May until July.</p>
<p>Possibly the most unusual bird of the park is the <span class="small">DIPPER</span>, or &ldquo;water
ouzel,&rdquo;&mdash;a chunky little dark-gray bird, with a habit of bobbing up
and down constantly, which is seen only near rushing mountain
streams or waterfalls. It hops into rushing water and even walks
submerged on the stream bottom in search of aquatic insects&mdash;a method
of food-gathering that appears suicidal but actually does the dipper
no harm. The mossy, dome-shaped nest is usually built where spray
can keep it moist. Look for these amazing creatures at Chasm Falls,
at The Pool, along Mill Creek and Glacier Creek, or in the cascades
in Wild Basin.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this brief treatment of the birds will arouse your
interest in these important members of the park&rsquo;s wildlife population.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">MAN IN THE ROCKIES</span></h2>
<p>At least a thousand years ago many Indians passed through the
park region. Evidences of their presence are few but conclusive.
Arrow points, hand hammers, and even crude pottery fragments
have been collected, and some are on display in the Moraine Park
Visitor Center. In the past 200 years or so, the park was the haunt
of the Utes (whose main territory was west of the Continental Divide)
and, latterly, of the Arapahoes who ranged the plains east of the
park. Many old Indian trails have been logged in the park; Trail
Ridge was named for its Indian trail.</p>
<p>After the United States acquired the region through the Louisiana
Purchase, a number of explorers and adventurers passed near the park
in their travels: Stephen Long in 1820, William Ashley in 1825,
Richard Dodge in 1835, Eliza Farnham in 1839, Frederick Wislizenus
in 1839, Rufus Sage in 1840, John C. Fremont in 1843 and 1844, Francis
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
Parkman in 1846, and Frederick Ruxton in 1847. From his narrative,
there is reason to think that Sage might have been in Wild Basin; if
so, this would mean that he was the first explorer to set foot in what
is now Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>

<p class="pcap">Both Ute and Arapaho Indians hunted in these mountains.</p>
</div>
<p>On October 15, 1859, Joel Estes and his son topped Park Hill and
saw what is now Estes Park. The next year, Estes settled his family
in the grassy meadow&mdash;a &ldquo;park&rdquo; in Colorado terminology. It soon
became known as Estes Park, a name in use to this day. By 1867,
the Estes family claim was acquired by Griff Evans, who later
transferred his rights to a British nobleman, the Earl of Dunraven.</p>
<p>Dunraven&rsquo;s influence on the region was, perhaps, more beneficial
than his antagonists would have admitted. Many enterprises that
would have seriously marred the matchless landscape were kept out
of his feudal regime, saving (although quite accidentally) many beauty
spots for later generations. He also did much to publicize the region;
one of his guests was the artist Albert Bierstadt.</p>
<p>During the 1880&rsquo;s a mining boom occurred in what is now the west
side of the park, leading to the establishment of Lulu City, Dutchtown,
and Teller. Grand Lake had already been discovered, and a
small but rather exciting community grew up on its shore, serving
the needs of the new mining camps. You can see the crumbling
cabins of Lulu City by taking a 3-mile hike up the Colorado River
valley.</p>
<p>By 1910, many people began thinking of a National Park here, as
that new invention, the automobile, was finally proving practicable
as a means of travel. Although there were many supporters of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
National Park idea throughout the land, one man&mdash;Enos Mills, naturalist,
philosopher, writer&mdash;is credited with carrying the idea to a
tangible result. He was rewarded for his years of hard work and
innumerable frustrations when he participated in the dedication
ceremonies for Rocky Mountain National Park on September 4, 1915.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CLIMATE</span></h2>
<p>The climate of any part of the world is due to many forces&mdash;but
basically to the amount of energy received from the sun. In mountainous
areas, such as Rocky Mountain National Park, the climate is
made more variable by the different altitudes, slopes, and exposure to
solar radiation. Like all midlatitude regions, too, the park experiences
invasions of different air masses with their varying qualities and the
storms associated with their fronts.</p>
<p>Few frontal storms are experienced in summer. Most of the frequent
thunderstorms are produced by the elevation and cooling warm
air from the Gulf of Mexico as it streams into the mountains from the
southeast. This season provides the great cumulus clouds that delight
the photographer. During autumn, winter, and early spring the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
weather is determined by alternate invasions of cold Canadian air
and cool Pacific air. The latter brings much snow to the western side
of the park, but usually results in favorable weather on the eastern
slope; the warm chinook winds are associated with these conditions.
The Canadian air&mdash;usually heralded by blizzards on the plains below
the mountains&mdash;brings snow and below-zero temperatures to the east
slope. The winter weather at the village of Estes Park is often milder
than in most of the plains country to the east, because of the protection
afforded by the mountains from the full forces of these air movements.</p>
<p>In general, the weather is ideal for summer vacations, with cool,
clear nights and sunny days. The frequent afternoon showers are
mere refreshing interludes in an otherwise delightful season. The
winter weather, although often rigorous, is relatively mild for the
region&rsquo;s altitude, and, although the high Trail Ridge Road is snow-blocked,
scarcely ever is it a problem to drive from Estes Park village
to Denver or other plains communities.</p>
<p>It is always cool at night, even in midsummer, so bring warm clothes;
western garb is always socially acceptable. The region is noted for
its friendly informality. For hiking on trails and camping, old field
clothes are desirable, and stout, comfortable shoes are a necessity. A
slicker is important, since afternoon showers may be expected.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">PARK SEASON</span></h2>
<p>Although the park is officially open to travel all year, summer&mdash;June
through September&mdash;is the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; season. From October until
May, high-altitude roads are blocked by snow, as are most park trails
in winter. All but one of the visitor centers are closed, and naturalist
hikes and other activities are not scheduled after September 15. Camping
is difficult from September to May because of adverse weather and
limited facilities. However, the roads to both Estes Park and Grand
Lake are usually open throughout winter, and accommodations are
available in both gateway towns during the off-season.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">WHAT TO DO</span></h2>
<p>For most visitors, the park&rsquo;s scenic splendors are the chief attraction.
There is a choice of several auto drives; and miles of trails
beckon those who prefer hiking or horseback riding. A few of the
principal automobile and trail trips are described below.</p>
<p>The park ranger-naturalist activities are popular; so is fishing, a
park sport for which a State license is required. All activities within
the National Park are keyed to the natural scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The principal winter-use area in Rocky Mountain National Park
is at Hidden Valley along Trail Ridge Road, 10 miles west of Estes
Park. Skiing, ice skating, snowshoeing, and platter sliding are popular
here. The area is designed for family winter use, not as a typical
ski resort. There are down-mountain ski runs and several practice
areas so that either the expert or the novice skier will find slopes to
his liking. Ski tows service popular slopes. A lodge and a warming
shelter are provided at two popular locations within the area for
the use of winter sports enthusiasts. Rental equipment, food service,
lounge, and other facilities are available at the visitor center. Cross-country
skiing may be enjoyed by the experienced skier at numerous
locations on the eastern side of Rocky Mountain National Park and
on the western slope in the vicinity of Grand Lake.</p>
<p>Here are a few photo hints: the light is intense at high altitudes;
many shots are made at half the exposure needed nearer sea level.
Mornings are best for pictures; afternoons are often cloudy. Use side-light
for depth, and break up the foreground on long shots. Color
film will not register accurately the intense light of the sky and the
dark green of the forest on the same exposure. Film, filters, and
other supplies are available at the gateway towns. Color slides are
sold at Moraine Park Visitor Center and nearby curio shops.</p>
<h3 id="c18">Automobile Trips</h3>
<p>Mountain driving is different from ordinary automobile travel, and
presents special problems. In most of the park a speed limit of 35
miles per hour is enforced (20 m.p.h. on curves). This permits
leisurely sightseeing; but do not stop on the road. Stop in a parking
area and walk back to a scenic spot, if necessary. Vapor lock, which
often stalls cars, is caused, in part, by driving the car up steep grades
in high gear; use lower gears and keep the motor cooler. Most cars
stalled by vapor lock will start after cooling off for about 10 minutes.
Keep your car in gear and use lower gears, if possible, on down grades,
too; do not use overdrive. Drive carefully and courteously. Gateway
towns have the usual auto services.</p>
<p><i>Trail Ridge Road.</i> The 50-mile drive from Estes Park to Grand
Lake across the Front Range in Rocky Mountain National Park is
one of America&rsquo;s most magnificent auto trips. Trail Ridge Road, a
modern, hard-surfaced road, is usually open from late May to mid-October.
For sheer scenic beauty, for easy access to the fantasies of
treeline and tundra, and for a variety of natural landscapes within a
few miles, Trail Ridge Road has few equals anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Trail Ridge proper is a massive ridge extending easterly from the
Continental Divide. In the early days an Indian trail crossed the
mountains via this ridge&mdash;hence the name. The present road was
built by the National Park Service in the early 1930&rsquo;s on a route
chosen for maximum scenic possibilities and minimum snow-clearance
problems.</p>

<p class="pcap">From Rainbow Curve, an extensive view to the east affords glimpses of the
lower levels of Trail Ridge Road.</p>
</div>
<p>The lofty peaks of the Colorado Rockies have been sculptured by
glaciers into a bewildering network of rocky ridges, sheer cliffs, needlelike
crags, and great cirques. Until roads were built, much of this
breathtaking scenery was accessible only to hardy mountain climbers.
Now all can see choice samples of high country from a car.</p>
<p>Although every mile of this road affords scenes of great interest
and rare beauty, several points deserve special attention: Many Parks
Curve permits close observation of the chipmunk, golden-mantled
ground squirrel, and Clark&rsquo;s nutcracker, and excellent views of the
meadows. To the north is Fall River Valley, and beyond, the towering
peaks of the Mummy Range. This valley was the melting basin
of a great glacier. The fine view to the south includes Longs Peak
(14,256 feet), looming over the green flats of Beaver Meadows and
Moraine Park. Several moraines&mdash;long, generally parallel ridges of
broken rocks built up at the edges of glaciers and now heavily forested&mdash;stretch
out before you, separating one park from the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Above Many Parks Curve, the road climbs along the north side of
Trail Ridge, loops about the head of upper Hidden Valley (where
skiing is in vogue during the winter), passes the 2-mile elevation sign,
and reaches another parking area at Rainbow Curve, about 8 miles
from Deer Ridge, and one-half mile higher in altitude. The view
from Rainbow Curve is vast, open, and superb, with the Great Plains
visible far to the east and forested canyons or glacial meadows nearer
at hand. Many interesting geological features are pointed out on the
roadside exhibit panels at this point.</p>
<p>Leaving Rainbow Curve, the road follows the rim of another deep
canyon, passing through a ghost forest, scene of a devastating fire
in the 1870&rsquo;s. Grotesquely formed treeline trees reflect the harsh
climate at this high altitude. As the Rock Cabins are passed, a superlative
view opens up to the south across Forest Canyon. For several
miles the road traverses the Alpine zone tundra, carpeted during
July by low-growing, colorful flowers.</p>
<p>Glaciated mountains south of Trail Ridge Road can be seen to best
advantage from Rock Cut (altitude 12,110). Gorge Lakes, Forest
Canyon, and other landscape features are indicated in roadside exhibits.
If time permits, a short hike can be made over a nature trail
to the nearby Roger W. Toll Memorial Peakfinder. A walk along
this trail provides a rare opportunity to become acquainted with the
tundra; however, the high altitude affects some people adversely, so
it may not be advisable for persons with heart ailments to attempt the
trip.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig42">
<img src="images/p29a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="535" />
<p class="pcap">Winter snows lie deep at higher elevations of the park.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Iceberg Lake, which occupies a glacial cirque, was named from the
presence of blocks of ice that remain on its surface even in late summer,
except in extremely warm and dry years. The reddish cliffs
at this point are made up of relatively recent lava, which is not common
in the park. The highest point (12,183 feet, marked by a sign)
is between Iceberg Lake and Fall River Pass. The pass is a popular
stopping place, with restrooms, alpine exhibit room, and lunch
counter.</p>
<p>Below Fall River Pass the road continues downhill all the way to
Grand Lake. The Continental Divide is crossed at Milner Pass at an
altitude of 10,758 feet, in the midst of a typical spruce-fir forest. As
Far View Curve is approached, the valley of the Colorado River comes
into view, and the rugged Never Summer Range looms up to the
west. The road descends from this point in sharp switchback curves
to reach the wide floor of the Colorado Valley. From here to Grand
Lake, the route follows the valley. Deer and elk are often seen in
this vicinity. The lake itself, over 250 feet deep, is one of Colorado&rsquo;s
scenic gems. The town of Grand Lake, outside the park, is a friendly
western town with the usual resort accommodations.</p>
<p><i>Bear Lake Road.</i> This is a short spur road, leaving from Beaver
Meadows Entrance on one of the eastern approaches to Trail Ridge
through Moraine Park and Glacier Basin to Bear Lake, nestled at the
foot of the high mountains. Everyone should make this trip, if time
permits&mdash;an extra hour or so will do it. The road traverses glaciated
meadows and moraines; it affords splendid views of Longs Peak.
Great stands of aspen on Bierstadt Ridge make this a colorful drive
in autumn. Bear Lake, at the end of the road&mdash;the only high lake
in the park accessible by auto&mdash;is a foreground for the view up Tyndall
Gorge, with the sheer cliff of Hallett Peak making a dramatic backdrop
to the alpine scene. A half-mile trail encircles the lake, giving
different scenic effects with every step, and nature-trail labels aid in
enjoyment of the rocks, wildflowers, and trees. A short hike&mdash;a mile
or so&mdash;from Bear Lake to Dream Lake gives you an opportunity to
escape auto traffic and see some of the park, without undertaking too
arduous a climb.</p>
<h3 id="c19">Trail Trips</h3>
<p>You are urged to take at least one trail trip, for only on the trails
can you experience the real essence of the mountains. Everyone has
his favorite trail; you can make your own selection. The first decision
is whether to hike or ride a horse&mdash;or to try both methods. In
any case, leave your car behind for at least 1 day of your visit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<div class="img" id="fig43">
<img src="images/p30.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="649" />
<p class="pcap">Although Grand Lake is outside the park, an excellent view of it can be obtained
from within the park.</p>
</div>
<p>Certain rules covering trails should be observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>To avoid getting lost stay on designated trails. Repeated short cuts
damage the trails, necessitating repairs.</i></p>
<p><i>If you are hiking, yield right-of-way to horses by standing quietly
off the trail as the riders pass.</i></p>
<p><i>Deposit trash in receptacles; keep trails free of litter.</i></p>
<p><i>If you plan to cook out, obtain a fire permit from a park ranger.
This is a fire-protection regulation.</i></p>
<p><i>Leave dogs behind. Their presence on trails disturbs wildlife.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With some 200 miles of trails in the park, beginning at a dozen
different points and ending at scores of destinations, you may have
difficulty planning your trail trips before you arrive. Information on
the various trail trips is best obtained after you get to the park. The
park rangers, the museum attendants, the naturalists, and the saddle-horse
operators can help you outline trips.</p>

<p class="pcap">A short hike from Bear Lake takes you to Dream Lake, with its matchless view
up Tyndall Gorge.</p>
</div>
<p>A brief description of a few of the popular trips follows:</p>
<h4><i>Trails from Bear Lake.</i></h4>
<p>One of the trail hubs of the park is Bear
Lake. A &ldquo;must&rdquo; is the 1-mile hike to Dream Lake, near the foot of
Hallett Peak. From Dream Lake you can take a primitive trail
another mile to Emerald Lake in Tyndall Gorge or a developed trail
to Lake Haiyaha in Chaos Canyon. Each trip is an excellent half-day
hike. You may want to go along the big moraine to Bierstadt Lake,
or to the top of Flattop Mountain from Bear Lake&mdash;a long, uphill
climb, with a reward of marvelous views. The splendid all-day hike
to Odessa and Fern Lakes begins here, too. This can be a loop trip,
via Cub Lake, returning to Bear Lake; or, if you can arrange to be met
in Moraine Park, an excellent 9-mile &ldquo;through&rdquo; hike with a minimum
of uphill walking is possible.</p>
<h4><i>Glacier Gorge Trails.</i></h4>
<p>A mile below Bear Lake is a parking area
from which trails lead in several directions. Two short hikes&mdash;about
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
4 hours each&mdash;are possible from here to Lake Mills in Glacier Gorge
(at the foot of Longs Peak) and to The Loch, a lovely mountain lake.
From these lakes, dim &ldquo;fishermen&rsquo;s&rdquo; tracks lead on to higher and
more remote lakes. From The Loch a primitive path leads to Andrews
Glacier. These latter tracks are not really trails and, although
easily followed, usually require some local specific information. There
is also a seldom-used, constructed trail from Glacier Gorge parking
area up to Boulderfield near the top of Longs Peak. This makes a
good horseback trip but is not popular with hikers because the destination
is so much more easily reached by the shorter trail from Longs
Peak Campground. A spur from this trail leads, via Storm Pass, to
Tahosa Valley.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig45">
<img src="images/p31a.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="608" />
<p class="pcap">Only by trail can you reach such high-country lakes as this.</p>
</div>
<h4><i>Fern Lake Trail.</i></h4>
<p>At the end of the Moraine Park Road is a picnic
area. A trail begins here which follows Big Thompson River, past
beaver dams and The Pool, to Fern Falls and Fern Lake. From
Fern Lake the trail continues to Odessa Lake and on to Bear Lake.
Many people leave Bear Lake, reaching Moraine Park by this trail.
The trip is about 9 miles; 6 hours gives ample time for a leisurely
pace.</p>
<h4><i>Wild Basin Trails.</i></h4>
<p>Many persons consider Wild Basin the finest
wilderness area in the park. Trails begin here at the road&rsquo;s end and
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
lead up the branches of North St. Vrain Creek to many beautiful lakes.
One popular hike (about 4 hours) is to Ouzel Falls, via Calypso
Cascades, and return. Most of the other trips in Wild Basin are
longer and make more suitable all-day hikes. Thunder Lake is one
of these spots. Ouzel and Bluebird Lakes make another 1-day trip
combination. There is no trail across the range here, but some fine,
back-country hiking possibilities exist for the sturdy, seasoned hiker.</p>
<h4><i>Western Slope Trails.</i></h4>
<p>Many people hike or ride horseback from
Bear Lake over Flattop Mountain to Grand Lake via either Big
Meadows or North Inlet. This takes all day as compared with 2 or
3 hours by road. However, the trail trip is through much splendid
scenic country which is not seen by the highway traveler between
these two points. Hikes in the Grand Lake vicinity include one to
Shadow Mountain Fire Lookout, with matchless panoramic views,
and the interesting &ldquo;trail to nowhere,&rdquo; up Columbine Creek. The trail
distances to major points of interest on the west slope are longer than
on the east side of the park, and many people prefer to use horses.
By riding, trips to Lake Verna in East Inlet and Lakes Nokoni and
Nanita in North Inlet can be made in 1 day. A number of spectacular
horseback trips in Never Summer Range are possible. Saddle-horse
operators can help you plan such trips in this vicinity.</p>
<h4><i>Trails in the Estes Park Vicinity.</i></h4>
<p>Several interesting trail trips
near Estes Park village and in the lower altitudes of the park are
available. These are especially pleasant early or late in the season
when many of the higher trails are snow-blocked. Gem Lake is
reached by a 2-mile trail (3 hours or so) which begins about 1 mile
from town on the Devils Gulch Road. This trip presents interesting
rock formations and fine panoramic views. Twin Sisters is a high,
isolated mountain south of Estes Park, reached by a trail beginning
on State Route 7. A good hike for about 7 hours takes one to the
top of this mountain and back in a leisurely manner. The view of
the plains from Twin Sisters is extensive, and treeline flowers add
color to the trip. There are several other hiking trails in this area.</p>
<h4><i>Trails near Trail Ridge Road.</i></h4>
<p>At Deer Ridge, a trail leads to the
commanding summit of Deer Mountain, which is a fine, early-season
hike although dry in midsummer. On the tundra, a trail leads
from Rock Cut on the road to the Memorial Peakfinder. A trail
also leads from Iceberg Lake to Fall River Pass. At Milner Pass a
trail leaves the highway, passes through an especially beautiful forest,
and reaches the top of Specimen Mountain. This hike affords matchless
scenic views, particularly of the Never Summer Range, fine displays
of wildflowers, and possible glimpses of bighorn. Near the spot where
Trail Ridge Road begins the ascent of the western slope, a trail leads
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
up the Colorado River to the ghost town of Lulu City, and branches
continue to Poudre Pass, Thunder Pass, and beyond.</p>
<p>Many of these trails&mdash;and others&mdash;can be covered by visitors on summer
trips with the park ranger-naturalists. These escorted hikes help
you to get your bearings in the park, as well as understand the natural
features encountered along the route. If you are interested in hiking,
you should join a few of these naturalist trips. In this way, you
quickly realize the possibilities for your unescorted hikes, if you prefer
to travel on your own. The park ranger-naturalists will help you plan
other hikes and will do all they can to make your trail trips safe,
interesting, and enjoyable.</p>
<p>This outline of trail-trip possibilities is only a beginning. There are
also trips to Lawn Lake, Tyndall Glacier, Windy Gulch, the North
Fork of the Thompson River, and Chasm Lake. Information on the
far more difficult mountaintop trips is not included here. If you
expect to ascend such mountains as Longs Peak or McHenry&rsquo;s Peak,
be sure to consult the park ranger at the nearest ranger station or go
to the chief ranger&rsquo;s office in Estes Park village. Routes to be followed
may vary from week to week because of changes in snow conditions;
ask park rangers for up-to-date information. Remember to get a fire
permit if you plan to camp out on the trail.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
